It's me again. Finally, it's the end of the term and the DS class has finished! I think I did
great in this course. 
I am very happy with my performance and this subject has teach me many different ways to solve questions! 
I also obtained my targeted grade and i worked really hard during this course. Maybe i could've procrastinate
less and work more! */

My name is Shawn with matrix number,22004874. I am
majoring in Artificial Intellingence. This is my first time taking the
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling nervous about taking this
subject. This is because this subject is very hard.

I acquired A for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I
think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term. In order
to do well in the subject, I will do my best. Wish me luck */
